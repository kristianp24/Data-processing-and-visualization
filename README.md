# 📊 Data Processing & Visualization App

> 🚀 Collaborative Python + Streamlit app for exploring built-in datasets, regression, clustering & stats

This project, built with a friend at university, showcases **data processing**, **visualization**, **regression**, **clustering**, and more—all powered by **Streamlit** using **pre-loaded sample datasets**.

📂 **Datasets Used**:  
- ⚽ [Football Clubs Data (clubs.csv)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/davidcariboo/player-scores?select=clubs.csv)  
- 👥 [Football Players Data (players.csv)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/davidcariboo/player-scores?select=players.csv)
